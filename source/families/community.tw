<p class="fade-text">''Dr. Garfield Williams:'' You are the moderator for your household and will guide the household in its initial discussion of the information you have about the war with Germany.</p>

<<timed 3s t8n>>
<p>Answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Will there be another bombardment and, if so, when?</li>
    <li>Should we move back to the community air raid shelter or stay in our own homes another night?</li>
</ul>
<<next 2s>>
<p>To answer these questions, evaluate the information you currently have about the war and determine if it is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Current (which includes relevancy)</li>
    <li>Authoritative</li>
    <li>Truthful (which includes accuracy)</li>
</ul>

<<next 2s>>
<p>Also, assess the bias that this information might reflect. Identify any additional information you might need and be able to gather such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What is the Luftwaffe strategy for bombing English cities?</li>
    <li>How many British people have been injured or died so far during the war?</li>
    <li>What air raid precautions were in place in Britain during the war?</li>
</ul>

<<next 2s>>
<p>What do you do next?</p>

<<next 2s>>
<p>Use the ACT UP handout to evaluate the information that you have.</p>

<<next 2s>>
<<set _seconds to 1500>>
<span id="countdown"><b>Countdown</b>&nbsp;15:00 remaining!</span>
<<silently>>
	<<repeat 1s>>
		<<set _seconds to _seconds - 1>>
		<<if _seconds gt 0>>
            <<set _min to Math.trunc(_seconds / 60) >>
            <<set _sec to Math.trunc(_seconds % 60) >>
            <<if String(_sec).length lt 2>>
                <<set _sec to "0" + String(_sec) >>
            <</if>>
